    <p>Lab 8 Scope and Encapsulation</P>
    <p>CS472 Web Applications Programming</P>
    <p>Implement the following in the IDE. You can send all the output to the console. Make some</P>
    <p>comment on the html page that the output is in the console.</P>
    <h1>Exercise 1:</h1>
    <p>Define a filter function on the String object. The function accepts an array of strings that</P>
    <p>specifies a list of banned words. The function returns the string after removing all the</P>
    <p>banned words.</P>
    <p>Example:</P>
    <p>console.log("This house is not nice!".filter('not'));</P>
    <p>Output: "This house is nice!"</P>
    <h1>Exercise 1 output:</h1>
    <div id="Exercise1" style='color: blue;'> </div>
    <h1>Exercise 2:</h1>
    <p>Write a BubbleSort algorithm on the Array object. Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm</P>
    <p>that works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted,</P>
    <p>Example:[6,4,0, 3,-2,1].bubbleSort();</P>
    <p>Output : [-2, 0, 1, 3, 4, 6]</P>
    <h1>Exercise 2 output:</h1>
    <div id="Exercise2" style='color: blue;'> </div>
    <h1>Exercise 3:</h1>
    <p>Create an object called Teacher derived from a Person function constructor, and implement</P>
    <p>a method called teach that receives a string called subject, and prints out: [teacher's name]</P>
    <p>is now teaching [subject]. Create a Teacher object and call its teach method.</P>
    <p>Also do the same thing using Object.create. When using Object.create you will need a</P>
    <p>factory function instead of a function constructor in order to pass parameters such as</P>
    <p>‘name’ to be set in the prototype.</P>
    <h1>Exercise 3 output:</h1>
    <div id="Exercise3" style='color: blue;'> </div>
    <h1>Exercise 4:</h1>
    <p>Write code that will create person, student, and professor objects.</P>
    <p>• Person objects have</P>
    <p>o name and age fields</P>
    <p>o a greeting method that prints out: “Greetings, my name is [name] and I am</P>
    <p>[age] years old.”</P>
    <p>o a salute method that prints out: “Good morning!, and in case I dont see you,</P>
    <p>good afternoon, good evening and good night!”</P>
    <p>• Student objects inherit name, age, and salute from person. They also have a field</P>
    <p>‘major’ and have their own greeting method. Their greeting is “Hey, my name is</P>
    <p>[name] and I am studying [major]. The greeting should be output to the console.</P>
    <p>• Professor objects inherit name, age, and salute from person. They also have a field</P>
    <p>‘department’ and have their own greeting method. Their salutation is “Good day,</P>
    <p>my name is [name] and I am in the [department] department.” Output it to the</P>
    <p>console.</P>
    <p>• Create a professor object and a student object. Call both the greeting and salutation</P>
    <p>methods on each.</P>
    <p>• Do this exercise once using the object prototype approach for inheritance and then</P>
    <p>using the function constructor approach.</P>
